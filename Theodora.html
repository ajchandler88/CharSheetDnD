                        <p>    As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerun's great institutes of learning , where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home- not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.</p><p>The most well known of Faerun's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.</p><p>Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerfin.</p>

                        <p>You have proficiency with tinker's tools. Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materiaIs to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours. (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materiaIs used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p> 
                        <p><b>Clockwork Toy:</b> This toy is a clockwork animal or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.</p>
                        <p><b>Fire Starter:</b> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light something like a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.</p>

                    The	magic	items	you	create	with	this	feature	are	
                    effectively	prototypes	of	permanent	items.
                        <h2>Infusions	Known</h2>
                    When	you	gain	this	feature,	pick	three artificer	
                    infusions	to	learn,	choosing	from	the	“Artificer

                    description.	You	learn	additional	infusions	of	
                    your	choice	when	you	reach	certain	levels	in	this	
                    class,	as	shown	in	the	Infusions	Known	column	
                    of	the	Artificer	table.
                    Whenever	you	gain	a	level	in	this	class,	you	can	
                    replace	one	of	the	artificer	infusions	you	learned	
                    with	a	new	one.
                        <h2>Infusing	an	Item</h2>
                    Whenever	you	finish	a	long	rest,	you	can	touch	a	
                    nonmagical	object	and	imbue	it	with	one	of	your	
                    artificer	infusions,	turning	it	into	a	magic	item.
                    An infusion	works on only certain	kinds	of	
                    objects,	as	specified	in	the	infusion’s description.
                    If	the	item	requires	attunement,	you	can	attune	
                    yourself	to	it	the	instant	you	infuse	the	item,	or	
                    you	can	forgo	attunement	so	that	someone	else	
                    can	attune to	the	item.	If	you	decide	to	attune	to	
                    the	item	later,	you	must	do	so	using	the	normal
                    process	for	attunement (see	“Attunement”	in	the	
                    Dungeon	Master’s	Guide,	page	136).
                    Your	infusion	remains	in	an	item	indefinitely,	
                    but	when	you	die,	the	infusion	vanishes	after	a	
                    number	of	days	have passed	equal	to	your	
                    Intelligence	modifier	(minimum	of	1	day). The	
                    infusion	also	vanishes	if	you	give	up	your	
                    knowledge	of	the	infusion	for	another one.
                    You	can infuse	more	than	one	nonmagical
                    object	at	the	end	of	a	long	rest;	the	maximum	
                    number	of	objects	appears in	the	Infused	Items	
                    column	of	the	Artificer	table.	You	must	touch	
                    each	of	the	objects,	and	each	of	your	infusions	
                    can	be	in	only	one	object	at	a	time. If	you	try to	
                    exceed	your	maximum number	of	infusions,	the	
                    oldest	infusion	immediately	ends,	and	then	the	
                    new	infusion	applies.</p>

                    alchemist’s	supplies	are	with	you,	you	can	form	
                    this	homunculus	in	an	unoccupied	space	within	
                    5	feet	of	you. If	you	already	have	a	homunculus	
                    from	this	feature,	the	first	one	immediately	dies.</p>
                    <p>The	homunculus	is	friendly	to	you	and	your	
                    companions,	and	it	obeys	your	commands.	See	
                    this	creature’s	game	statistics	in	the	Alchemical	
                    Homunculus	stat	block. You	determine	the	
                    homunculus’s	appearance,	which	includes	wings	
                    and bits	of	alchemical	equipment.	Some	
                    alchemists	prefer	mechanical-looking	birds,	
                    whereas	others	like	winged	vials	or	miniature	
                    cauldrons.</p>
                    <p>In	combat,	the	homunculus	shares	your	
                    initiative	count,	but	it	takes	its	turn	immediately	
                    after	yours.	The	only	action it	takes	on	its	turn	is	
                    the	Dodge	action,	unless	you	take	a	bonus	action	
                    on	your	turn	to	command	it	to	take	one	of	the	
                    actions	in	its	stat	block	or	to	take	the	Dash,	
                    Disengage,	or	Help	action.</p>
                    <p>If	the	mending spell	is	cast on it,	it	regains 2d6
                    hit	points.	If it has	died	within	the	last	hour,	you	
                    can	use	your	alchemist’s	supplies as	an	action to	
                    revive	it,	provided	you	are	within	5	feet	of	it	and	
                    you	expend	a	spell	slot	of	1st	level	or	higher. The	
                    homunculus	returns	to	life	with	all	its	hit	points	
                    restored.</p>
